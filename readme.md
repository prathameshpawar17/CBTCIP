## IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
Iris flowers have three species: 1. setosa, 2. versicolor, and 3. virginica, each of which differs in their measurements. 
Let's say you have the measurements of the iris flowers for each of the species, and your task is to train a machine learning model to learn from these measurements and classify the irises accordingly.
The dataset contains:
1. Iris-setosa - 50
2. Iris-versicolor - 50
3. Iris-virginica - 50
   
## Model used for deployment : KNeighborsClassifier

## Highest Accuracy Score - 1.00

## Other model used :
1. LogisticRegression
2. DecisionTreeClassifier
3. LinearDiscriminantAnalysis
4. GaussianNB
5. SVC
   
I completed the task successfully and made a website to predict the class using machine learning model.
